# hello-world
Well the tutorial requires it so I'm not gonna complain

Something about me: I'm currently studying Bachelor Electronics and Business. It has lot of to do with physics and electronics of course, but also with embedded systems and telecom technologies, and some programming in C and embedded C, linux programming etc.

So that's basically why I'm here. Technically a newbie, but would love to work in electronic, and even better in IT industry.
